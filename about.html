                <h2 class="subtitle">What is this project and why did I start it?</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">I started this project when I was looking around for something to do. I wanted to learn how to code, so I started on <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard">the ODIN project</a>. I would highly recommend it for any beginners looking to start in web development, or even more intermediate coders who would like to learn a new language or improve their Javascript or Ruby skills.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p class="paragraph">Once I had a base of web development knowledge, I wanted to actually <em>apply</em> those skills somewhere. I'm currently a third year neuroscience student at the University of Edinburgh, and I've always been very passionate about mental health and sleep. I wanted to create a website that serves to educate people, in a fun way, about a topic which is currently underfunded and underresearched.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p class="paragraph">Sleep is incredibly important for physical and mental wellbeing, something I want to emphasize with this. Structuring a society which doesn't allow people to sleep enough, the rise of a "grind" culture which promotes foregoing sleep in favour of work, and an almost competitive quality to missing sleep (I swear, if another person tells me 'well <em>I</em> only slept <em>four</em> hours last night' when I share that I'm tired) are not in line with healthy, happy people.</p>
