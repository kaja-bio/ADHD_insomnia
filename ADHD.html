        <h2 class="subtitle">What even is ADHD?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">ADHD is one of the most common <strong>neurodevelopmental disorders</strong>. A neurodevelopmental disorder means that the differences in the brains of a person with ADHD come about during neural (brain) development during the embryonic stage - so before you’re born. Of course, there’s many factors that can affect the symptoms of ADHD during your lifetime, so it’s
        certainly not static. Symptoms of ADHD are varied, including problems with attention, hyperactivity, and impulse control
        (and if you trust the opinion of any of my friends with ADHD, a ‘great sense of humor’ and ‘unparalleled
        attractiveness’’. The scientific evidence behind this is, as of yet, sparse).</p>
        <p class="paragraph">There are three categorized subtypes of ADHD: predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive and impulsive, and
        combined (Wilens, 2013). This doesn't mean all people who fall into one category are the same, but that their symptoms
        usually fall into the same groups. Most people are predominantly inattentive, and ADHD-hyperactive-impulsive is the
        least common subtype (Ayano, 2020)</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The cause behind ADHD is relatively poorly understood, but is thought to be a variety of genetic and environmental factors (Núñez-Jaramillo et. al, 2021). There are a lot (a LOT) of possible risk factors for an embryo developing ADHD:</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><ol>
            <li><em>Fetal hypoxia</em> (not enough oxygen) can affect the <strong> dopaminergic pathways</strong> (pathways in the brain involving the <strong>neurotransmitter</strong> <strong>dopamine</strong>). Some <strong>enzymes</strong> (e.g. <strong>tyrosine hydroxylase</strong>) required for the synthesis of dopamine require oxygen to function - without it, less
            dopamine is produced. Simultaneously, some areas of the brain (such as the <strong>substantia nigra</strong>, a structure involved in functions such as fine-tuning motor movement and reward pathways, which has been found to be altered in patients with
            ADHD) are affected (Giannopoulou et. al, 2018). So if you’re pregnant and really set on ensuring your baby has a normal
            dopaminergic pathway, I’d advise rescheduling your trip to outer space or the Death Zone of Mount Everest. At least for
            a few months. Once the baby is born, I’m sure it’s fine.</li>
            <img class="comic" src="" alt="fetal hypoxia">
            <li><em>Pesticide</em> exposure has been shown in rats to induce ADHD symptoms (Richardson et. al, 2015), which I find fascinating. It’s one thing to call a person impulsive because you decided to spend all your money on a property in Costa Rica rather than paying off student loans, but it’s quite another to label a rat ‘impulsive’. </li>
            <img class="comic" src="" alt="impulsive rat">
            <p>Rat studies aside - please don’t huff pesticides if you’re pregnant. As a matter of fact, try to avoid it even if you’re
            not pregnant. </p>
            <li><em>Genetic factors:</em> The gene <strong>BDNF</strong> encodes a protein called BDNF (scientists are inventive with their naming like that). The protein, which is short for Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor, is important for many things within the <strong>Central Nervous System</strong>. It promotes the survival, maturation and <strong>differentiation</strong> of neurons, and enhances 
            <strong> synaptic plasticity</strong> (Bathina and Das, 2015), which refers to the fact that neurons can weaken or strengthen their connections at synapses, an important feature for memory formation. Some studies have found a correlation between lower levels of BDNF and ADHD - which means issues with making new neurons and maintaining old connections, including in the (you guessed it) dopaminergic pathway (Núñez-Jaramillo et. al, 2021). There’s a lot of other genetic and other factors at play that I haven’t even touched upon, and even the ones we currently suspect we don’t fully understand yet. Considering the scope of the issue and the variety of ADHD presentations, that’s not entirely surprising.
            Nevertheless, if you happen to come upon some revelation that explains everything, please email me. Or maybe somebody
            more qualified.</li>
        </ol></p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">The neurobiology of ADHD</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">We’ve gone over some ideas of how ADHD can come about, but we haven’t really discussed what’s <em>different</em> about someone with ADHD. You likely already have a relatively good idea of what ADHD is on the psychology side of things -
        impulsiveness, trouble focusing, issues with time management, problems completing tasks, all that fun stuff (Mayoclinic,
        2023). But what about the actual neurobiology? As in, what is the brain of someone with ADHD actually like? We’ll look
        at two major things: the dysfunction in the reward cascade and the gross brain structure (gross as in, like, big or
        total, not gross as in disgusting. We’ll look at why the brain is gross later. Don’t skip ahead though, you’ll spoil the
        ending for yourselves. <sup>2</sup></p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">The Reward Cascade</h2>
        <div class="footnotes"><p><sup>2</sup> Okay fine, I'll spoil it for you already. The brain is gross because it's folds of wet fat sitting inside a bone-cave.</p>
        <div class="paragraph"><strong>Reward deficiency syndrome (RDS) </strong> involves a group of disorders where there is an issue in the brain's reward mechanisms due to dopamine resistance. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter,
                a chemical messenger that carries signals from one neuron to another, which is heavily involved in the brain's
                reward and
                pleasure pathways. Issues with the metabolism of dopamine have been implicated in the etiology of ADHD for a long
                time.
                In experiments on mice missing dopamine transporter genes (genes for proteins called transporters that make sure
                dopamine is
                recycled and taken back up into the first, or presynaptic, neuron, thus ensuring that we still have dopamine present
                to carry
                messages), studies have found signs of hyperactivity (Blum et al., 2008). Guess who else is hyperactive?
                <p><em>That's right. ADHD folks.</em></p>
                <p>Coincidence? I don't think so!</p>
                <p>(Don't accuse me of bad science. I know correlation doesn't equal causation. Let me have this one.)</p>
            </div>
            <img class="comic" src="" alt="Hyperactive Emil">
            <div class="paragraph"><strong>Lesions</strong> on <strong>dopaminergic</strong> neurons in certain parts of the brain
                have resulted in symptoms of ADHD in studies,
                showing the link between dopamine deficiency and ADHD. Brain-imaging studies have also helped prove that defects in
                dopamine explain
                many of the symptoms behind ADHD (Blum et al., 2008).</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Early studies found genes coding for the dopamine <strong>receptors</strong> to be important in
                impulsive and addictive behaviors;
                defects in the dopamine receptor could mean that even if dopamine is present in the brain, its binding to the
                receptor is somehow
                defective and so signal transduction is altered. Additionally, genes that code for dopamine transporters are also
                implicated in
                ADHD. Dopamine is involved in the reward cascade. It's one of the final steps in a cascade of different
                neurotransmitters released
                after a pleasurable stimulus, which also means it's involved in many diverse drug addictions that all result in
                stimulation of the
                dopamine pathway. It's produced in the ventral tegmental area or VTA, a structure in the midbrain, which then
                projects to limbic
                and cortical areas. The mesolimbic pathway is the major reward-related center in the brain, projecting from the VTA
                through to
                the <strong>nucleus accumbens, amygdala </strong> and <strong>hippocampus</strong>.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">The <strong>nucleus accumbens</strong> processes the rewarding stimuli that come in and helps
                reinforce it. We get food, it tastes good, the nucleus accumbens says “Hey, let's do that again!”. It deals with
                pleasure and generally liking things.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">The <strong>amygdala</strong> processes a lot of emotional learning and behavior. It's also
                well-known as a ‘fear center' of the brain -
                whenever you read about scientists traumatizing rodents, it's likely the amygdala is implicated in there somehow
                (Salzman, 2016). Unless it's just a passion project, in which case <em>my</em> amygdala is lighting up right now.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">The <strong>hippocampus</strong> is also a part of <strong>the limbic system</strong> and plays a
                crucial role in learning and memory (Dhikav & Anand,
                2012).</div>
            <img class="comic" src="" alt="Hippo campus">
            <div class="paragraph">Let's say we feed a baby their first donut. They're probably used to weird mashed baby food and
                parents trying to
                force-feed them broccoli or something, so the donut will probably release a whole lot of dopamine to the nucleus
                accumbens
                . Foods high in sugar have especially been found to stimulate the release of dopamine to the nucleus accumbens, so
                good
                for the baby! (Rada et al, 2005).</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Maybe not <em>good</em> for the baby. I don't know, I don't think you're supposed to feed them
                donuts.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">In our simplified model of the mesolimbic pathway, this would lead to ‘good' feelings
                when the amygdala is stimulated, and the hippocampus would go on to store this way in memory. The baby would now
                associate donuts with happiness.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Maybe not. Babies hippocampuses are probably pretty underdeveloped.</div>
            <img class="comic" src="" alt="Baby Hippo campus">
            <div class="paragraph">ADHD can result in lack of dopaminergic activity in the brain's pleasure center due to a variety
                of reasons. This can
                manifest itself outwardly in a variety of dopamine-seeking behaviors. Any readers with ADHD probably know the
                feeling of
                intense, soul-crushing boredom that comes from being under-stimulated. I've gone on 3am runs (and immediately
                regretted
                it), doodled all over my school notebooks, bought and lost fidget toys, decided I was going to become a muay thai
                fighter and told myself I'll teach myself to code and make a website just to ward off the boredom, because oh my
                <em>God</em>
                does it suck.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">It's nice to know it's not just in your head, right?</div>
            <div class="paragraph">I suppose it is in your head, but you get what I mean.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Some studies have actually questioned how crucial the role of dopamine dysfunction in ADHD is. A brain imaging
                    study
                    conducted in Cambridge found that while people with ADHD did worse on tests of attentional performance, they had
                    similar
                    levels of dopamine receptors in their <strong>striatum</strong> as healthy individuals, and their levels of
                    dopamine increased by similar
                    levels when methylphenidate, commonly known as Ritalin, was administered (del Campo et al., 2013). Therefore,
                    although
                    Ritalin led to improvements in the performance in memory tests of people with ADHD, since it led to similar
                    improvements
                    in non-ADHD people, it likely doesn't treat something intrinsic to ADHD itself.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">This led to the researchers questioning the validity of the common claim that ADHD is primarily
                caused by a dysfunction
                in the dopamine pathway, and probably some test subjects going home and cleaning the hell out of their houses.
                For now, let's operate on the assumption that there probably is something off in the dopamine pathway in ADHD
                brains.
                Future research might entirely refute this, but current studies lean heavily towards this interpretation.</div>
            <p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Brain structure</h2>
            </p>
            <div class="paragraph">Aside from chemical differences, the ADHD brain is also physically different. The frontal
                circuitry, which deals with
                cognitive processes, is typically implicated in ADHD.
                Studies of brain volume differences in people with ADHD using MRI smaller <strong>cerebrum</strong> and
                <strong>cerebellum</strong> in ADHD individuals compared to controls.
                The cerebrum and cerebellum are two different things, but you can't tell me that whoever named those wasn't having a
                laugh.
                These differences in brain volume persisted past childhood and into adolescence and adulthood. They were also found
                in both
                unmedicated and medicated patients with no significant differences between the two groups, indicating the effect was
                because of ADHD and not
                the drugs used to treat it (Castellanos et al. 2002).
                What are the cerebrum and cerebellum? How might having a smaller volume of both of these impact someone? </div>
            <div class="paragraph">The cerebrum is the biggest part of the brain. It's what we usually think of when we think of the
                brain, the weird
                folded part at the top (more on that later, though!). The cerebrum deals with 'higher functions; it evolved later
                on,
                so rather than being involved in the basics things we need for our survival such as breathing or regulating internal
                homeostasis, it deals with conscious actions, such as learning, language or memory (Cleveland Clinic, n.d.). It's
                the
                brainy, pretentious one, the nerd that might forget to eat and drink water because they're doing maths. In a 90s
                movie, the cerebrum would be a scrawny kid with glasses who frequently gets pushed into lockers.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">While “cerebrum” is Latin for brain, “cerebellum” means little brain. I's like a cute little
                sibling who's a bit clingy and always attached to the older sibling. Except that the little sibling actually has
                most of the neurons in the brain
                - over 50%, despite only accounting for 10% of total brain volume! So maybe that's a poor metaphor. It's like a
                little
                sibling who grew to be 6 feet tall when you got back from college and now is the star football player at your old
                high
                school while you're looking at them and going “wait, weren't you learning to walk like a week ago?”. Its main
                function is to do with motor control, although it likely also controls other functions to do with 'higher' brain
                processes (Knierim, 2020).</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Some studies report that differences in volume between ADHD and typical brains is normalized by
                adulthood (Gehricke et al., 2017). Others have found differences in children and adults with ADHD in terms of
                <em>which</em> brain structure was
                impacted. Additionally, the severity of ADHD symptoms could be linked to volume of gray matter and the development
                of
                certain brain structures, with more severe ADHD displaying lower gray matter volume (Wu et al., 2019). As an aside,
                gray
                matter is the cell bodies of the neurons and dendrites, while white matter consists of the axons, the connections
                between the cell bodies. If your brain were a bunch of devices linked together with wires, the gray matter would be
                the
                devices while the white matter would be the wires. Aside from volume, differences in connectivity are an important
                marker of ADHD. For example, decreased connectivity between the frontal cortex and the visual network has been
                associated with an increase in hyperactivity in ADHD patients (Wang et al., 2020).
                The ADHD brain might just be worse at coordinating itself to do things. Communication in it is a little jangled, so
                when
                it wants to do a task, it’s a bit of an effort to get the message “let’s do this task!” to the brain region that
                could
                actually execute it.</div>
            <img class="comic" src="" alt="Poor communication">
            <h2 class="subtitle">Why is the brain so gross and how does this relate to ADHD?</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">Everyone has a unique brain (unless they’ve changed this feature recently and I haven’t been
                told). The folds (called <strong>gyri</strong> and <strong>sulci</strong> for the ridges and grooves respectively)
                that form during neural development form differently for
                everyone, but they might be especially pronounced with disorders such as bipolar disorder, autism or (you might have
                guessed this one) ADHD (Garcia et. al, 2021). It’s not just the chemicals that are acting up - the literal structure
                of
                the brain of someone with a neurodevelopmental disorder is different to someone who is neurodivergent. Kinda funky
                if
                you think about it!</div>
            <div class="paragraph">The research into the effects and reasons behind folding is actually really fascinating, with a
                lot of intersections between biology, psychology, physics, the whole shebang.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">The folds of our brains are pretty darn important. Mice seem to survive okay with smooth brains,
                but personally, I’ve only ever seen the descriptor “smooth-brained” used in a negative context. Folding gives us a
                whole lot of surface area
                and complexity - you might not believe it when meeting some people, but this is why we’re typically smarter than
                mice.
                We want that surface area! We want to have the space to make a lot of complex connections, learn, make memories,
                whatever your non-smooth brain desires.</div>
            <img class="comic" src="" alt="Smooth brain">
            <div class="paragraph">Alongside the usual factors biologists like to blame (looking at you, genetics) there seems to be
                a big role for
                mechanics in the development of the brain. Kara E. Garcia conducted studies where she used mathematical models to
                stimulate the brain folding and knock-on effects (more specifically, her group modeled folding in the
                <strong>cortex</strong> the outer
                layer of the brain. If you ever think of what the brain looks like, you’re probably thinking about the cortex. It’s
                the
                gross part <sup>3</sup>.
                When the brain is growing, before it’s even been folded and it still looks more like a gross, but at least smooth,
                hunk
                of fat, we can think of it as made up of two zones (Richman et. al, 1975). The outer zone will become the cortex
                with
                all the weird folds, and the inner zone (truly nominative determinism) is under it, hidden inside. Now the question
                is -
                does the cortex fold because of forces exerted by the outer layer or the inner layer? A theory proposed by Richman
                et.
                al in 1975 describes it as “buckling due to differential expansion”.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Right. That clears things up.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">To break that down: the inner layer and the outer layer grow at different rates. The outer layer,
                which will become the cortex, grows faster than the inner layer. Both layers are mechanically coupled to each other,
                so the <em>differential
                    expansion </em> (aka the different rates of growth or expansion) exert tension, which leads to the cortex
                folding (Kroenke &
                Bayly, 2018). The cortex is <em>big</em>> in comparison to the rest of the brain - it’s the seat of your conscious
                processes. You'd hope it'd be big. It has to grow a lot more and a lot faster than the layers under it, and this
                causes it to fold - which is quite beneficial to us, because the increased folding leads to a lot more surface area
                and connections between different parts of the brain.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Another theory was proposed by Van Essen in 1997 that posited that it was the tension which axons
                exert in the inner zone that causes folding, as explained in the digrambelow (Xu et al., 2010).</div>
            <img class="comic" src="" alt="Folding diagram">
            <div class="paragraph">Obviously, cortical folding occurs because tiny little strings attach and move to pull gray areas
                of the brain towards each other (but also up and down and together and down again and then they relax maybe?). My
                personal hypothesis is that little
                gnomes live in our heads and push the folds of our brain together just out of boredom.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">The paper is still in the works.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">The left side of the digram shows the hypothesis that I explained first, the idea that the
                different growth rates of the‘layers’ of the brain result in tension which causes folding. The right and wayyy more
                complicated looking side shows
                the axon hypothesis, about tension caused by axons causing folding.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Personally, I would have stuck with the left one. Just for appearance’s sake.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Neurons <strong>in culture</strong> and <strong>in-vivo</strong> are under tension when they’re
                stretched, and behave in an elastic manner (Essen, 1997).The theory was thus that this tension creates folding by
                pulling closely connected areas together, which would also help
                explain the very individual wirings of different brain. However, more recent studies seem to be showing that axon
                tension does not likely play a significant role in cortical folding (Xu et al., 2010b). The tension that they exert
                might still alter brain <strong>morphology</strong> (the structure of the brain) somewhat, but is likely not enough
                in itself to actually
                create the kind of folding that we find in human brains.</div>

            <div class="paragraph">That was a bit of a tangent - but a cool tangent at that!
                So why does any of this matter?</div>
            <div class="paragraph">as I mentioned before, differences in cortical folding seem to be a really important property of
                ADHD, and a lot of other disorders involving the brain (Wolosin et al., 2009). Studying how the brain folds can help
                us understand how it
                goes wrong. A lot of factors seem to go into it - environmental factors such as prenatal alcohol exposure or
                nutrition
                status might impact the <strong>gyrification</strong> (a word for the folding of the brain - and isn’t it a great
                word? Gyrification.
                Sounds like something a sci-fi author would come up with to describe what happens to people in the dystopian world
                when
                they disobey the government and are put into the Meat People Grinder Xtreme) (Gharehgazlou et al., 2020).</div>
            <div class="paragraph">It’s really fascinating to think about these differences people with ADHD have, because it’s easy
                to slip into thinking that mental disorders are just some ephemeral thing which have no physical bases - but our
                thoughts, our very view of
                the world, are all based off of the physical structure that is our brain, and our brains can be very, very
                different!</div>
            <div class="paragraph">It might be easy to assume that someone with ADHD is lazy (and maybe they are - we can all be
                lazy sometimes), but maybe their brain is also just built completely differently. A little geneticist God took the
                Lego blocks making up our
                brains, shook them up, and threw them all together haphazardly. Also, the Lego blocks are made mostly of fat. Gross,
                moist Lego blocks. No wonder it’s hard to put them together in a way that doesn’t make me forget my wallet every

            <h2 class="subtitle">The link between iron and anemia</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">Something which I’ve learned recently and found absolutely fascinating is that anemia (a lack of
                iron) and ADHD are linked. In fact, lack of iron can be linked to a lot of cognitive deficiences. I know it seems
                like a relatively strange connection, but buckle up, because it’s pretty cool!
                Or skip ahead to the end of this section, where I give you a quick tl;dr. Either way.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">The first way is cooler, though.</div>
            <p>
            <div class="paragraph">Iron levels are measured using a serum <strong>ferritin</strong> test. This doesn’t measure iron
                directly; rather, it measures the levels of ferritin, a protein in the body used to store iron. Several studies have
                noted the correlation between iron deficiency and exacerbation of ADHD symptoms. One study by Sever et al. tested
                the effect of supplementing the diet of
                children with ADHD with iron supplements, and found that not only did the serum ferritin levels increase (from 25.9
                ±
                9.2 to 44.6 ±18 ng/ml), but their ADHD symptoms seemed to decrease in severity. This was measured by their parents
                filling out something called a questionnaire called a Connors rating scale, which is supposed to give an indication
                about ADHD severity. The downside of this study was the smaller sample size and, as always with ADHD studies, it’s
                very
                difficult to empirically measure ADHD severity. Nonetheless, this seems promising!</div>
            </p>
            <div class="paragraph">Another study also found links between low serum ferritin, indicative of anemia, and ADHD. This
                clinical study found that serum ferritin levels were “extremely low” in a third of the children in the study with
                ADHD, compared to normal
                levels in control children (Bener, 2015). A link between cognitive issues and iron deficiency has actually long been
                established. This isn’t to say lack of iron is the big cause behind all ADHD cases, but it may be one of the
                precipitating factors. It’s likely that ADHD requires a combination of genetics, environmental factors and more to
                actually become ADHD as we know it but this is still a useful piece of information. The paper also highlighted links
                between vitamin D levels and ADHD, concluding that supplementing both iron and vitamin D to infants might be a
                useful way of reducing ADHD
                risk. Additionally, it might be useful to consider the risk of anemia in patients with ADHD and subsequently
                supplement
                their diet with iron to help manage both anemic and ADHD symptoms.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">So why does this link between ADHD and iron exist? This is the fun part!
                Iron is actually involved in the synthesis of <strong>dopamine</strong>. It acts as a cofactor to an
                <strong>enzyme</strong> called <strong>tyrosine hydroxylase</strong>. A cofactor means it has a job as a ‘helper
                molecule’ in the enzyme’s work of catalyzing a reaction. Tyrosine hydroxylase converts the dopamine precursor,
                tyrosine, to dopamine (the name tyrosine hydroxylase is actually an example of the very rare occasion where
                scientists aren’t obtuse with their naming - it literally hydroxylates tyrosine by adding an oxygen onto it). If we
                don’t have enough iron, this reaction can’t proceed, and that means we subsequently don’t have enough dopamine.
                Hey! Hey, wait a second. The whole thing about ADHD is not having enough dopamine!
                Yup, you're onto something.
                Here’s your tl;dr if you skipped ahead (and made me sad):
                Iron is needed to convert the dopamine precursor into dopamine. If we don’t have enough iron, we can’t make enough
                dopamine. As ADHD is a dysfunction of the dopaminergic pathway, this additional lack of dopamine can easily
                exacerbate symptoms or possible even help cause ADHD in the first place.
                Weird, huh? </div>
            <div class="paragraph"> Don’t go licking nails now though, please. You can get iron supplements at Lidl I’m pretty sure.

            <h2 class="subtitle">How is ADHD treated?</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">I just want to throw a little aside into this section before we get started.
                I am <em>not</em> a doctor. I don’t want you going and telling your parents that you took a random pill your weird
                neighbor sold
                you in her garage because an internet writer told you it would help with your ADHD. This section isn’t telling you
                to do
                <em> anything at all</em> - it’s purely an overview of how ADHD is being treated and how it might be treated in the
                future.
                If there's an angry parent reading this, please don’t sue me. I just wanted to make little comics and read about
                weird brain
                stuff.
                And frankly, if your kids are doing weird shit because a random internet person told them to, you might have to up
                the parenting. Ever heard of internet safety? Give the kids a talk, sheesh.
            </div>
            <img class="comic" src="" alt="Internet safety">
            <div class="paragraph">Available treatments for ADHD can be split into two categories: pharmacological and
                non-pharmacological. I’m going to
                focus primarily on the pharmacological treatment - not because I think it’s more important, but purely because I’m
                interested in the chemistry of it. Additionally, some medications have the possibility of a relevant side effect -
                insomnia (Wilens & Spencer, 2010). (And sometimes, that same medication has been found to help insomnia. So maybe we
                just don’t know anything at all.)
                The first class of medications available to treat ADHD are stimulants, such as Ritalin or Adderall.
                These are “sympathomimetic drugs which increase intrasynaptic catecholamines (mainly dopamine and norepinephrine) by
                inhibiting the presynaptic reuptake mechanism and releasing presynaptic catecholamines” (Wilens & Spencer, 2010).
                Obviously that should have explained everything. Easy peasy, feel like you can’t focus? Simply increase your
                intrasynaptic catecholamines (mainly dopamine and norepinephrine) by inhibiting the presynaptic reuptake mechanism
                and…
                Christ, that’s a mouthful. And I’m not even speaking, I’m just writing it.
                Let’s break that down.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">Sympathomimetics <em>mimic</em>the activation of the <em>sympathetic</em>nervous system. The
                sympathetic nervous system is also called the ‘fight or flight’ system, for pretty obvious reasons. So does that
                mean sympathomimetic drugs cause people with ADHD to constantly be in fight or flight mode? Wouldn’t that make them
                super anxious and jumpy?
                Well, yes and no. Sympathomimetics can have a lot of side-effects that mirror this fight-or-flight response, such as
                increased heart rate and blood pressure. When you’re running away from something, you want to be pumping a lot of
                blood
                to your muscles to oxygenate them. You might also have gastrointestinal issues since your brain has decided it
                doesn’t
                need to focus on digestion right now because hey, maybe there’s a bear chasing you (Vitiello, 2008). Or maybe you’re
                just stressed about a big job interview.
                The brain still isn’t very good at distinguishing between the two and recognizing that maybe you’d like to be
                digesting
                things while discussing your weaknesses and why you’d love to work at this firm or that firm, instead of feeling
                like
                you need to go sprint up a hill to get rid of all your nervous energy.
                So is that it, then? The drugs will just make you super jumpy? Doesn’t seem like it’d help with ADHD much.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">We also have to consider the fact that people with ADHD already have less dopamine and
                norepinephrine or faulty wiring
                in their brains! With correct dosage,they shouldn’t be jittery, but paradoxically calmer and more focused. For
                example,
                a study by Claire Advokat and Mindy Scheithauer found that college students performed better on memory recall tests
                when
                medicated compared to their non-medicated counterparts. There was also a reliable improvement in the performance of
                medicated ADHD students on tasks that required inhibition (e.g. they have to wait before making a choice). In
                general,
                stimulants seem to improve concentration, focus, working memory, and some studies have even found increased gray
                matter
                volume, or at least a trend towards normalizing gray matter volume (Nakao et al., 2011). Despite this, stimulants
                can
                have negative side effects - and, interestingly, might not improve academic performance in people with ADHD. Despite
                improving working memory and concentration, compared to taking placebo, people with ADHD taking stimulants didn’t
                perform better in the study by Advokat and Scheithauer. Huh.
            </div>
            <img class="comic" src="" alt="Tetanus">
            <div class="paragraph">This seems a bit weird. If the drugs make someone calmer, more focused and more likely to realize
                mistakes, shouldn’t that help their academic performance?
                The researchers tested out a bunch of theories behind why this might be. Say stimulants don’t negatively alter the
                person's cognitive performance - maybe the issue is with the other effects of the drugs? Amphetamines are used
                recreationally for lots of reasons, not just making you more focused. Some people abuse them for perceived euphoric
                effects. If they cause euphoria, that might well explain the lack of improvement in academic performance. After all,
                euphoric people don’t tend to make the most well thought-out decisions (citation: I don’t know, the whole of
                Euphoria. I
                mean, I never actually finished that show, so I don’t know how euphoric anyone was. But I sure know they were
                abusing
                the hell out of some stimulants, and I somehow get the feeling they weren’t using them to treat their ADHD).
                So is it the euphoria?
                Probably not. McCloskey et al. found that people with ADHD traits seem to enjoy stimulants and experience its
                euphoric
                properties less than non-ADHD people. Sorry, ADHD people.
            </div>
            <img class="comic" src="" alt="euphoria">
            <div class="paragraph">One alternative theory has been that stimulants decrease “cognitive flexibility” (Advokat &
                Scheithauer, 2013). The idea
                of cognitive flexibility is the ability to respond differently when the environment changes and the ability to
                switch
                ways of thinking. If you’re a weird corporate person, you can interpret this as “thinking outside the box” and throw
                it
                onto a poster with clipart of a dancing brain or something.
                Additionally, stimulants might increase the effects of environmental distractions (if we again consider the fact
                that
                they are sympathomimetics and supposed to put you on ‘climb up a tree or go fight a bear with your bare hands’ mode,
                it
                makes sense why you might be more primed to pay attention to your environment). And a person paying a lot of
                attention
                to their environment rather than the test in front of them is likely to not do super well.

            <div class="paragraph">Enough psychology (I mean, it’s been <em>one whole paragraph</em>. I’m a biologist, not a
                psychologist). How do psychostimulants help people with ADHD manage their symptoms? What do they actually do?
                Let’s look at Ritalin and Adderall and their methods of action in a bit more detail:
                Ritalin is an example of a <strong>methylphenidate</strong>, Adderall is an <strong>amphetamine</strong> (just like
                speed! Fun fact of the day. Please don’t take speed to treat your ADHD though, I haven’t done my research on this
                but my gut says it’s not a good plan).
                Both methylphenidate and amphetamines increase levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, just in slightly different
                ways.
                The first method of action is that both of them inhibit dopamine and norepinephrine transporters (Faraone, 2018).
                Wait - if we can’t transport dopamine and norepinephrine, wouldn’t that be worse? Don’t you want to be able to
                transport
                neurotransmitters around the brain or something?
                We need a bit of a basic understanding of how signals are sent along the brain to understand this. A signal is sent
                from
                one <strong>axon</strong> to another through a junction, called a <strong>synapse</strong>. It binds to receptors on
                the second cell. Transporters ofneurotransmitters then shuttle the neurotransmitter from where it’s acting in the
                synapse back into the presynaptic
                cell. In the presynaptic cell, the neurotransmitter is recycled so it can be used again - in the case of dopamine
                and
                other <strong>monoamines</strong>, it’s broken down by an enzyme called MAO (no relation to the former chairman of
                the Chinese Communist
                Party. At least, no relation that I know of). The transporters thus act to stop the neurotransmitter from acting on
                the
                postsynaptic cell and exciting it. Inhibiting this transporter therefore means the neurotransmitter, in this case
                dopamine and norepinephrine, stays in the synapse for longer and continues exciting the second neuron. This
                essentially
                results in something akin to there being more dopamine and norepinephrine, without actually increasing their levels.

            <div class="paragraph">Amphetamine also inhibits the actions of MAO, the enzyme breaking down dopamine in the
                presynaptic cell, and
                methylphenidate acts as an agonist to serotonin receptors (i.e. it causes the same reaction as serotonin would by
                binding to serotonin receptors and mimicking serotonin’s effects) (Faraone, 2018). The primary sites of actions are
                the
                cortex and striatum.
                Remember: the cortex is the wrinkly outer part of the brain. It’s the newest part in terms of our evolutionary
                history
                and so it’s also associated with the ‘highest’ level functions, such as thinking, learning, and generally being
                aware
                you’re a human and you have a consciousness. Being ‘higher-level’ functions doesn’t make them more important, though
                -
                I’ve survived 20 years with barely any reasoning skills, but I’d rather not lose my ability to breathe.
                The striatum is part of the basal ganglia and controls some movement functions and is involved in the reward
                cascade.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">There’s further cellular and whole-brain effects that I haven’t even touched - it’s a complicated
                system! It’s important
                for physicians to consider everything for people with ADHD if they have comorbid issues, because many are due to
                issues
                in the same neurobiological pathways.
                Additionally, we haven’t really talked about the side effects. We can’t really (yet) engineer a drug to act just in
                the
                places we want it to. Dopamine and norepinephrine have actions all over the brain, so if we start fiddling around
                with
                their levels, it’ll change lots of parts in the brain, too.
                This can include mood changes and irritability or insomnia (hey, look at me linking the parts of the website
                together)
                (Advokat & Scheithauer, 2013). Interestingly, a lot of the side-effects aren’t related to these higher-brain
                functions,
                but might include dry mouth, decreased appetite, and other unfortunate symptoms (Psychopharmacology Institute, n.d.)
                Why is this?
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">The brain uses the same neurotransmitters for a lot of functions. We can’t really make the
                dopamine act in just one partof the brain (not yet). Dopamine is involved in the reward and feeding cascade, so
                increasing dopamine levels will
                likely make us less hungry.
                Also, remember that the drugs are sympathomimetics - they activate the sympathetic nervous system. When we activate
                the
                sympathetic nervous system and get the fight or flight nervous response, we divert focus away from making saliva or
                from
                feeling hunger because again, why would we focus on the fact that we could really go for a burger right now when
                you’re
                accidentally steering your car off a cliff. So it makes sense you’d feel less hungry taking some of the drugs for
                ADHD!</div>
