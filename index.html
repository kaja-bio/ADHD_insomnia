        <h1>Whether you have ADHD, insomnia or you're just interested in the science, welcome to my webpage!</h1>
        <p>I'll be taking you on a journey through the two conditions and their intersections, with the help of Casper
            the ghost and his friends in the form of comics. </p>

            <p>This is Casper. He's a bit confused sometimes, but a lovely guy (ghost). He has ADHD, but he doesn't let that define him. He mostly just defines himself as "ghost". His hobbies include haunting, screaming, wearing unflattering bedsheets, and bothering his friend Kaja. </p>
            <p>He has as of yet been unsuccessful with the above Tinder bio. He argues that this is primarily because of ghost prejudice. </p>
            <p>ADHD and insomnia - how are they related? The fact is, the conditions are comorbid and occur together at high rates, yet there's not a lot of research into either causes or treatment. This page is meant to highlight this and serve to educate (in preferably a relatively fun way) about the research done so far on this topic.</p>
